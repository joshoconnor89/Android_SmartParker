# SmartParker
Android App

SmartParker (beta) is an Android app written by Joshua O'Connor in the Fall of 2014.  It was a class project for UCSD's Mobile App Development program.  The requirements for this class project were to incorporate hardware, geolocation, and storage in your Java based android application.  This was achieved by using the camera for hardware, SQLite for storage, and Google Maps.  This project is still in beta.

App Description:
SmartParker is an Android app which keeps a track of where you parked.  When you park in an unfamiliar place, simply open up SmartParker, and track your car's location by creating a parking log which can be accessed later.
